# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public issue or disclose the issue publicly.**
2. **Report the vulnerability privately to the maintainers.** If you are unsure who to contact, you can check the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for guidance.
3. **Provide detailed information.** Include information about the vulnerability and how it can be reproduced. If possible, provide a proof-of-concept or example.
4. **Allow time for the maintainers to respond.** The maintainers will acknowledge your report and work to identify and address the issue.

## Security Response

The maintainers will strive to respond to security vulnerability reports promptly. Here's what you can expect:

- **Acknowledgment.** You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within one week.
- **Investigation.** The maintainers will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability.
- **Resolution.** Once the issue is resolved, a security advisory will be published, and credit will be given to the reporter if requested and applicable.
- **Public Disclosure.** The maintainers will coordinate with you on an agreed-upon timeline for public disclosure if required.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To ensure the security and privacy of our users, we kindly request that security researchers follow these guidelines:

- **Provide a reasonable amount of time for the maintainers to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.** We appreciate your cooperation and responsible disclosure.
- **Do not compromise the privacy and security of our users, systems, or data.** Do not attempt to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or destroy data.
- **Follow the principles of responsible disclosure.** Avoid automated scanning, social engineering, or any other activities that may cause harm.

Thank you for helping keep our project safe and secure!
