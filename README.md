NJITBytes is an innovative hackathon project that taps into the New Jersey Institute of Technology's dining hall menu API to provide custom and personalized meal plans for students and faculty. With the power of AI integration, our platform analyzes the dining hall's offerings and tailors meal suggestions to meet the dietary preferences, restrictions, and goals of each individual user.
